           <h2>Fighting world hunger... for FREE?</h2>
           <h1>YES!<span>...not really</span></h1>
           <p>We knew that FreeFarms had to be the frontrunner of produce from the very beginning. Here at
           FreeFarms, we saw a global need for good quality food, but, how do we get it to everyone
           around the world? Well, we made it FREE for everyone (not really)!</p>
           <h3>But, how do we sow, cultivate and distribute everything for Free?</h3>
           <p>That's the beauty of it... we don't! We love our staff and we pay them what they're
           worth. That's why we are here to disclose that FreeFarms, isn't actually free. Sorry :( <br>
           We still deliver top quality produce to your door or supermarket, so at least there's that ;)</p>
           <h3>Taking part in preserving our environment</h3>
           <p>Preserving the natural balance of our environment is also a central pilar into what FreeFarms
           is all about. We employ top of the line agricultural scientists and architects to ensure
           our product is as sustainable as possible. We fertilize our soil with only natural composting materials
           and use no chemical pesticides, so not only will you never consume toxic chemicals with FreeFarms,
           but we make the environment better than how we left it. It's super expensive though, so you
           are going to have to pay a little extra for that. Consider it a donation to Mother Earth.</p>
